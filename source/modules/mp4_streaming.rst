MP4 Streaming Lite
==================

Description
-----------
**mod_mp4_streaming_lite** - seeks a certain time within H.264/MP4 files when provided when a "start" parameter is provided in the URL.

This module is written by Jiang Hong. You can contact him for a full (but commercial) version which supports a wider variety of MP4 files.

The most recent package can be downloaded here:

`<http://i.6.cn/nginx_mp4_streaming_public_20081229.tar.bz2>`_.

.. note:: *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the `installation instructions <mp4_streaming.installation_>`_.

    - start=0 (or 0.0) was allowed in order to send the re-indexed whole file.
    - a directio-related neglect was fixed.

.. _mp4_streaming.installation:

Installation
------------

Download the tarball as described above and ``tar jx`` it.

After extracting, add the following option to your Nginx ``./configure`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

  --add-module=path/to/mp4_streaming_lite/directory


By default, nginx uses ``-O`` to compile the source code. You should use:

.. code-block:: bash

  --with-cc-opt='-O3'


with ``./configure`` to retrieve maximum performance.
