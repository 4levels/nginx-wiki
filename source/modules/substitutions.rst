Substitutions
=============

Description
-----------
**nginx_substitutions_filter** - a filter module which can do both regular expression and fixed string substitutions on response bodies. This module is quite different from the Nginx's native Substitution Module. It scans the output chains buffer and matches string line by line, just like Apache's `mod_substitute <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_substitute.html>`_.

.. note:: *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the `installation instructions <substitutions.installation_>`_.



Example
-------

.. code-block:: nginx

  location / {
      subs_filter_types text/html text/css text/xml;
      subs_filter st(\d*).example.com $1.example.com ir;
      subs_filter a.example.com s.example.com;
  }



Directives
----------
* subs_filter_types_
* subs_filter_


subs_filter_types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Syntax: *subs_filter_types mime-type [ mime-types ]*
:Default: *text/html*
:Context: *http, server, location*

subs_filter_types_ is used to specify which content types should be checked for subs_filter_.

This module just works with plain text. If the response is compressed, it can't uncompress the
response and will ignore this response. This module can be compatible with gzip filter module.
But it will not work with proxy compressed response. You can disable the compressed response like this:

.. code-block:: nginx

  proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";


subs_filter
^^^^^^^^^^^
:Syntax: *subs_filter source_str destination_str [gior]*
:Default: *g*
:Context: *http, server, location*

subs_filter_ allows replacing source string (regular expression or fixed) in the nginx response with
destination string. Substitution text may contain variables. More than one substitution rules per
location is supported. The meaning of the third flags are:

* ``g``: Replace all the match strings.
* ``i``: Perform a case-insensitive match.
* ``o``: Just replace the first one.
* ``r``: The pattern is treated as a regular expression, default is fixed string.
