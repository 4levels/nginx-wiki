"Nginx can interface with PHP on Windows via a FastCGI daemon, which ships "
"with PHP: php-cgi.exe. You need to run ``php-cgi.exe -b 127.0.0.1:<port>`` "
"and use ``fastcgi_fastcgi_pass_ 127.0.0.1:<port>;`` in the nginx "
"configuration file. After being launched, ``php-cgi.exe`` will keep "
"listening for connections in a command prompt window. To hide that window, "
"use the tiny utility `RunHiddenConsole "
"<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/attachments/660/RunHiddenConsole.zip>`_"
