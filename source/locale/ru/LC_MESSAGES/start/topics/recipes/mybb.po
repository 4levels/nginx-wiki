"There is a potential security flaw, e.g. if a user uploads an avatar images "
"pic.gif with valid PHP-Code and calls it with "
"/uploades/avatars/pic.gif/foo.php. The issue is discussed `here "
"<http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls#Passing_Uncontrolled_Requests_to_PHP>`_. "
"Because the link is ending with .php, nginx is passing it to the PHP "
"interpreter. PHP can't find the file /uploades/avatars/pic.gif/foo.php, but "
"it tries to be smart and executes /uploades/avatars/pic.gif as an PHP-"
"script. To avoid this, you need to set cgi.fix_pathinfo=0 in your php.ini, "
"which is set to cgi.fix_pathinfo=1 as default (unfortunately)."
