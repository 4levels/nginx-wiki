"**ngx_http_secure_download_module** - a module that enables you to create "
"links which are only valid until a certain datetime is reached. The way it "
"works is similar to lightttpd's mod_secdownload, but not exactly same."

"The way this works is simply that if you specify ``folder``, it will drop "

"Lets say you have a file in your document root under the path "

"Get the current timestamp, for example from "

"Now you need to decide for a secret string. It needs to be set in the nginx "

"\"privatestring\""

"Then you put the following string together "

"ok, you got everything you need, now you just have to put it together in the"
