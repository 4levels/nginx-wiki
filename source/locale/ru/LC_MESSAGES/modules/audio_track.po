msgid ""
"Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) has being adopted for almost all video "
"stream players, and one of their recommendations is to serve an audio-only "
"track to users that have experiencing bad bandwidth connections."

"This module aims to serve audio-only track directly on nginx, without the "
"necessity to pre-demux the stream on Video On Demand (VoD) scenarios or the "
"overhead and occupation of one stream output on the encoder side for live "
"streams."

"Using a combination of nginx locations with simple scripts written in Lua "
