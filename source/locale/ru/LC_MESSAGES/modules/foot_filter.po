"This is a module that is distributed with `Tengine "
"<http://tengine.taobao.org>`_ which is a distribution of Nginx that is used "
"by the e-commerce/auction site Taobao.com. This distribution contains some "
"modules that are new on the Nginx scene. The "
"**ngx_http_footer_filter_module** is one of them."
