"*Stay friendly*: Trolls, flooders, people with no social skills; they all "
"visit from time to time. If someone is abusive, warn them. If someone won't "
"learn or gets aggressive, remove them from the chat. If someone is "
"(accidentally) flooding: mute or remove that person and give the url to our "
"pastebin. Don't forget to unmute when you think the flood is over. Never "
"swear at people, though; always stay friendly. If you remove a very abusive "
"person, don't respond to the cheering you will get. Don't be surprised at "
"the abuse and swearing in private messages you will get either."

"*Don't hold ops*: After you did what you needed the operator privileges for,"
" de-op yourself. Staying +o for long times is not really useful and you'll "
"attract unneeded attention. A possible exception is when general commotion "
"might be going on in the channel and staying +o might be useful to indicate "
"to other members that you are around, so that they don't need to call !ops."

"*Don't use ignore*: Even when people are very offensive to you in private "
"chat, don't use your /ignore function. A soft-ignore (aka simply not "
"responding) works nearly as well. If you /ignore too much, chances are you "
"miss problems in the channel. Freenode also has +g user mode, which will "
"block private messages and notices, but not channel activity. If someone is "
"abusive in private, /mode <your_nick> +g can help, you can add exceptions "
"with /accept command. Do not filter your channel info (joins/parts/klines "
"etc). These also hold much info."

"*Ban on sight*: So far there have been no very abusive users. In extreme "
"cases users can be added to a special list in ChanServ that prevents them "
"from ever entering the channel again. If you think someone qualifies for "
"this list, discuss it with the other operators in #nginx-master."

"*Clean your bans regularly*: It is unavoidable that people will be banned. "
"Make sure you don't simply forget these bans and never remove them. Users "
"usually learn from their mistakes and very often any long term ban is not "
"needed. The IRC bot is a useful tool to review why a ban was put in place."

"*Comment on your bans*: ngxbot logs all kicks/bans/removes/mutes. You can "
"comment on your actions in the ban tracker. This is really useful to keep "
"track of both abusive users and bans that are around for a long time. "
"Comments can also be used to alert other OPs that a ban should not be "
"removed before talking to you. Ngxbot sends you a query after you create a "
"ban telling you how to comment on that ban. This makes it both very easy and"
" very efficient to add comments about bans which makes managing future "
"issues much easier."

"*Don't retaliate*: If someone misbehaves, don't retaliate. Take only the "
"appropriate actions to prevent further abuse (kick, ban, contacting freenode"
" staff). Retaliation is against the :ref:`community-irc-coc` and will make "
"us look bad as an operator team. As operators we expect users to retaliate "
"when we reprimand them. This is what a ban is for and if they attempt to "
"evade a ban we have further actions we can take. However, when operators "
"retaliate it can become extremely disruptive in a channel, especially if two"
" operators disagree. Retaliation from operators is unacceptable behavior."
