"Nginx is a piece of software that has been growing and has found the need to"

"In the free software world, we collaborate freely on a volunteer basis to "
"build software for everyone's benefit. We improve on the work of others, "
"which we have been given freely, and then share our improvements on the same"
" basis. We additionally help others learn about the software and help them "
"use it effectively. That collaboration depends on good relationships between"
" developers and users. Our team has agreed on the following code of conduct "
"to help define the ways that we expect all users and operators to adhere to."

"*Be Considerate*: Everyone is around to either help or be helped. We're all "

"*Be Respectful*: The Nginx community treats one another with respect. "
"Everyone can make valuable contributions to Nginx. We may not always agree, "
"but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and/or poor manners. We "
"might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that"
" frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that"
" a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a "
"productive one. We expect members of the Nginx community to be respectful "
"when dealing with all others. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is "
"expected to be perfect. Asking questions is how we learn. Those who are "
"asked questions should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a "
"question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate forum."

"*Stay On Topic*: The Nginx IRC channel is meant to be a means of support. "
"When other users are asking for support, they should not have to read your "
"random chatter about what you had for dinner. Chatter like this is unwelcome"
" when other users are seeking support. If the conversation is going to "
"become excessive or interfere with users seeking support, the conversation "
"is expected to find its way to #nginx-social or another off topic channel."

"*Don't Spam*: Things such as frequent nick changes, away nicks, pasting "
"multiple lines of text, displaying away messages, repeating questions "
"frequently, spamming the enter key, etc. are all forms of spam and are "
"unwelcome. There is little tolerance for spam in the Nginx community. Just "
"don't do it."
