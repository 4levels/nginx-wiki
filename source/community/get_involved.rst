Getting Involved
================

We do our best to make contributing to the Nginx community very easy. If you don't feel that
something is easy, then the easiest thing you can do is bring it up so we're
able to take action.

A short list of ways to get involved:

* If your blog has good quality Nginx topics, add it to :ref:`community-planet`.
* Jump into the :ref:`community-irc` and help answer questions.
* You can also :doc:`contribute <../contributing/index>` to Nginx and this wiki


There are other ways to contribute, but this is a list of our "big ticket" items.
