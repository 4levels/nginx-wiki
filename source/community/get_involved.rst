Getting Involved
================

We do our best to make contributing to the NGINX community very easy. If you feel that
a topic is too difficult to understand, please bring it to our attention so
we can take action.

A short list of ways to get involved:

* If your blog has high-quality NGINX topics, add it to :ref:`community-planet`.
* Jump into the :ref:`community-irc` and help answer questions.
* Report and track bugs using the NGINX `bug tracker`_.
* Subscribe to the :ref:`community-email`.
* You can also :doc:`contribute <../contributing/index>` to NGINX and this wiki.

There are other ways to contribute, but this is a list of our "big ticket" items.

.. _community-email:

Mailing List
------------

The `NGINX mailing list`_ is the most appropriate place for requesting help with
development issues. The IRC channel is filled mostly with server
administrators that don't do much NGINX development. If you need help with
NGINX development, then you should absolutely subscribe and participate on the mailing list.


.. _community-planet:

Planet Ngx
----------

`Planet Ngx`_ is a collection of blogs related to NGINX, aggregated into one
feed. If you're interested in having your blog aggregated here, it's pretty
simple. Just check out the README.mkd file in the `git repository`_.
