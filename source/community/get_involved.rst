Getting Involved
================

We do our best to make contributing to the Nginx community very easy. If you don't feel that
something is easy, then the easiest thing you can do is bring it up so we're
able to take action.

A short list of ways to get involved:

* If your blog has good quality Nginx topics, add it to :ref:`community-planet`.
* Jump into the :ref:`community-irc` and help answer questions.
* Report and track bugs using the Nginx `bug tracker`_.
* Subscribe to the :ref:`community-email`.
* You can also :doc:`contribute <../contributing/index>` to Nginx and this wiki.

There are other ways to contribute, but this is a list of our "big ticket" items.

Mailing List
------------

The `Nginx mailing list`_ is the most appropriate place for getting help with
development questions. The IRC channel is filled mostly with server
administrators that don't do much Nginx development. If you need help with
Nginx development, then you should absolutely jump on the mailing list.


.. _community-planet:

Ngx Planet
----------

`Planet Ngx`_ is a collection of blogs related to Nginx aggregated into one
source. If you're interested in having your blog aggregated here, it's pretty
simple. Just check out the README.mkd file in the `git repository`_.
